# bounce_game
 just creating a bounce game from my childhood, but it won't be exactly like that, there will be some changes I MEAN alot of changes, the only thing that will remain the same is the concept of it being a ball, though i don't think i can make this game myself... it's not about the coding though, i can do the coding of this thing all by myself, i just need someone else to come up with ideas and the map for it, i'm just not good with all this... would be great if someone could help me with this....
